## Syllabus

Number Systems: representation of unsigned and signed integers, 1's and 2's complement representation. Binary addition and subtraction. BCD and Gray codes. Error detection and correction using Hamming code.

Switching theory: Boolean algebra, logic gates and logic families to implement gates, and switching functions, truth tables and switching expressions, functional completeness.

Minimization of completely and incompletely specified switching functions, Karnaugh map and Quine-McCluskey method, representation and manipulation of functions using BDDs, two-level and multi-level logic circuit synthesis. 

Combinational logic circuits: multiplexer, decoder, encoder, comparator. Half adder and full adder, ripple-carry and carry-lookahead adder. Realization of Boolean functions using NAND/NOR gates, multiplexers, ROMs. Case studies. 

Sequential circuits: clocking and timing, flip-flops, latches, counters and shift registers. Finite-state machine model, synthesis of synchronous sequential circuits, minimization and state assignment. Asynchronous sequential circuits: basic concept, static and dynamic hazards.

Digital-to-analog and Analog-to-digital converters, basic terminologies and design alternatives.

ASM charts: Representation of sequential circuits using ASM charts, synthesis of output and next state functions.
