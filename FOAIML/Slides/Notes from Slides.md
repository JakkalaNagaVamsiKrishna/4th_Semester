`Random Experiment` is an experiment in which the outcome varies in an unpredictable fashion when the experiment is repeated under the same conditions.
`Outcome` is a result of the random experiment and it can not be decomposed in terms of other results. Denoted by $\zeta$ .
`Sample Space` of a RE is defined as the set of all possible outcomes denoted by $S$ 

Any subset $E$ of the sample space $S$ is known as an `event`.
Set of events or `Event Space` denoted by $F$ is a set whose elements are subsets of the Sample space.
