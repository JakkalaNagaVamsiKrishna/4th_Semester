> [!Note] Sets :
A Set is a group of objects represented as a unit. The objects in a set are called its elements or members. 

- For two sets A and B , A is a *subset* of B ($A \subseteq B$) if every member of A is also a member of B.
- *Proper Subset* : A is a proper subset of B $A \subset B$ if A is a subset of B and not equal to B.
- If we want to take the number of occurrences of members into account, we call it a multiset.
- 0 elements : empty set , 1 element : singleton set , 2 elements : unordered pair.
- the *Union* of A and B, written as $A \cup B$, is the set we get by combining all elements in A and B into a single set.
- the *intersection* of A and B written as $A \cap B$, is the set of elements that are in both A and B.
- The *Complement* of A written $A^c$ is the set of all elements under consideration that are not in A.
