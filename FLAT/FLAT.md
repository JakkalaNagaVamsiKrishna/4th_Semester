Regular expressions and languages, deterministic finite automata (DFA) and equivalence with regular expressions, nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) and equivalence with DFA, regular grammars and equivalence with finite automata, properties of regular languages, pumping lemma for regular languages, minimization of finite automata.
>3. Context-free languages and pushdown automata
