Central areas of theory of computation:
>[!Note] Automata Theory
Automata Theory deals with the definitions and properties of mathematical models of computation.

`A Finite automaton is a simple abstract machine in computer science that models computation by transitioning between a finite number of states in response to input symbols.`

Model Called *finite automaton* is used in text processing, compilers, hardware design.

`In computer science, as the use of recursively defined concepts increased, they were used more and more. In an early application , grammars are used to describe the structure of programming languages. In a newer application, they are used in an essential part of the Extensible Markup language(XML) called the Document type definition.`

Model Called *context-free grammar* is used in programming languages and artificial intelligence.

>[!Note] Computability
Discussion is about whether a problem can be solved or not.

> [!Note] Complexity
Classification is based on easy problems and hard problems.
