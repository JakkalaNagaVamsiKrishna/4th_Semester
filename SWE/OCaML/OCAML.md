# About the name 

O => object
CAML => Categorical Abstract Machine Language.
ML is a family of languages originally the "meta-language" for a tool.

# Aspects of Ocaml

- Immutable programming 
	Variable's values cannot destructively be changed; makes reasoning about program easier.
- Algebraic datatypes and pattern matching
	Makes definition and manipulation of complex data structures easy to express
- First class functions
	Functions can be passed around like ordinary values
- Static Type checking 
	Reduce number of run-time errors.
- Automatic type inference
	No burden to write down types of every single variable.
- Parametric polymorphism
	Enables construction of abstractions that works across many data types.
- Garbage collection
	Automated memory management eliminates many run-time errors.
- Modules
	Advanced system for structuring large systems.


# Five aspects of learning a Programming Language

1. Syntax : how do you write language constructs?
2. Semantics : What do programs mean? (Type checking, evaluation rules).
3. Idioms : What are typical patterns for using language features to express your computation.
4. Libraries : What facilities does the language(or a third-project) provide as "standard"?
5. Tools : What do language implementations provide to make your job easier?(Ex. top-level => using lang in command line, debugger, GUI editor, ....)
